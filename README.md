**Comment**:
```
Hi HN! I've just released IntelliScript v2.1, which I believe is the first CLI tool to integrate Google's LangExtract library.

What started as a simple AI command generator has evolved into a comprehensive data analysis platform. The v2.1 release adds:

- Structured data extraction from any text
- Interactive visualization generation
- Automated business report creation  
- Multi-step pipeline workflows

The interesting part is how it transforms the CLI from a single-purpose tool into a complete workflow engine. You can now go from raw text → structured data → analysis → visualized reports in a single command.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this direction for CLI tools!
